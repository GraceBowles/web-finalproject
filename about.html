            <p>Our primary goal is to connect people who have found injured or orphaned wild animals with those who can look after them and get them back into the wilds. Through a network of rehabilitators (government word for people who help wild animals) and wildlife rescue centres across Ontario we try to save as may wild animals as possible.
                The first 24 to 48 hours after a wild animal is found is the most critical. They usually have been without food or water for a while and are confused and afraid. Connecting with a wildlife professional quickly can save their life. Use this site to locate a wildlife rescue centre in your area or a centre that specializes in a particular species.
                The second goal of Ontario Wildlife Rescue is to help raise money for wildlife rescue centres across Ontario. Rehabilitation and wildlife rescue centre’s are not government funded in Ontario. They are completely dependent on donations and the public support. The smaller centres in particular do not have fundraising systems and spend most of their time and resources looking after animals. For them, even a few dollars can make all the difference.

              Renowned Muskoka Wildlife Advocate and founder of Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in Rosseau, Ontario, Audrey Irene Tournay, 89, passed away peacefully on November 29, 2019, in Parry Sound, Ontario. Audrey dedicated herself to wildlife rehabilitation full time. Her 460 acre homestead  property became the registered charity Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in 1987 and continues to operate to this day. For her contributions to wildlife rehabilitation and education, Audrey received the Animal Action Award from the International Fund of Animal Welfare and also the Paul Harris  Fellowship Award from the Rotary Club of Parry Sound. She retired in 2010, leaving behind a tremendous legacy in the countless thousands of orphaned and injured wildlife that were given a second chance through her kindness and dedication.</p>
